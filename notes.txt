A stream is an abstract interface for working with streaming data within Node.js.

A duplex stream is a stream which is both readable and writable.

Standard streams within computer programming are preconnected input and output communication channels between a program and its environment. Three I/O connections are standard input (stdin), standard output (stdout), and standard error (stderr).

Unix sockets (a duplex stream within Node.js) are biderectional sockets that exist in the domain of the local host and cannot be accessed over a network (exist on same host operating system).
